"and then get an overview with the :doc:`quickstart`. There is also a more"
" detailed :doc:`tutorial/index` that shows how to create a small but "
"complete application with Flask. Common patterns are described in the "
":doc:`patterns/index` section. The rest of the docs describe each "
"component of Flask in detail, with a full reference in the :doc:`api` "
