"uWSGI has multiple ways to install it. The most straightforward is to "
"install the ``pyuwsgi`` package, which provides precompiled wheels for "
"common platforms. However, it does not provide SSL support, which can be "
"provided with a reverse proxy instead."

"uWSGI should not be run as root with the configuration shown in this doc "
"because it would cause your application code to run as root, which is not"
" secure. However, this means it will not be possible to bind to port 80 "
"or 443. Instead, a reverse proxy such as :doc:`nginx` or :doc:`apache-"
"httpd` should be used in front of uWSGI. It is possible to run uWSGI as "

"The default sync worker is appropriate for many use cases. If you need "
"asynchronous support, uWSGI provides a `gevent`_ worker. This is not the "
"same as Python's ``async/await``, or the ASGI server spec. You must "
"actually use gevent in your own code to see any benefit to using the "
"worker."
