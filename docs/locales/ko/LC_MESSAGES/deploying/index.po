"After developing your application, you'll want to make it available "
"publicly to other users. When you're developing locally, you're probably "
"using the built-in development server, debugger, and reloader. These "
"should not be used in production. Instead, you should use a dedicated "
"WSGI server or hosting platform, some of which will be described here."

"\"Production\" means \"not development\", which applies whether you're "
"serving your application publicly to millions of users or privately / "
"locally to a single user. **Do not use the development server when "
"deploying to production. It is intended for use only during local "
"development. It is not designed to be particularly secure, stable, or "

"Flask is a WSGI *application*. A WSGI *server* is used to run the "

"The primary goal of these docs is to familiarize you with the concepts "
"involved in running a WSGI application using a production WSGI server and"
" HTTP server. There are many WSGI servers and HTTP servers, with many "
"configuration possibilities. The pages below discuss the most common "
"servers, and show the basics of running each one. The next section "
"discusses platforms that can manage this for you."

"interface. The links below are for some of the most common platforms, "
