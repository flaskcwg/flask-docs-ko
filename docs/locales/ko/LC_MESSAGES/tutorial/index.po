"While it's designed to give a good starting point, the tutorial doesn't "
"cover all of Flask's features. Check out the :doc:`/quickstart` for an "
"overview of what Flask can do, then dive into the docs to find out more. "
"The tutorial only uses what's provided by Flask and Python. In another "
"project, you might decide to use :doc:`/extensions` or other libraries "
"to make some tasks simpler."

"Flask is flexible. It doesn't require you to use any particular project "
"or code layout. However, when first starting, it's helpful to use a more "
"structured approach. This means that the tutorial will require a bit of "
"boilerplate up front, but it's done to avoid many common pitfalls that "
"new developers encounter, and it creates a project that's easy to expand "
"on. Once you become more comfortable with Flask, you can step out of "
"this structure and take full advantage of Flask's flexibility."
