"Many people prefer `SQLAlchemy`_ for database access.  In this case it's "
"encouraged to use a package instead of a module for your flask "
"application and drop the models into a separate module (:doc:`packages`)."
" While that is not necessary, it makes a lot of sense."

"Because SQLAlchemy is a common database abstraction layer and object "
"relational mapper that requires a little bit of configuration effort, "
"there is a Flask extension that handles that for you.  This is "
"recommended if you want to get started quickly."

"The declarative extension in SQLAlchemy is the most recent method of "
"using SQLAlchemy.  It allows you to define tables and models in one go, "
"similar to how Django works.  In addition to the following text I "
"recommend the official documentation on the `declarative`_ extension."

"To define your models, just subclass the `Base` class that was created by"
" the code above.  If you are wondering why we don't have to care about "
"threads here (like we did in the SQLite3 example above with the "
":data:`~flask.g` object): that's because SQLAlchemy does that for us "

"Manual object relational mapping has a few upsides and a few downsides "

"you define tables and classes separately and map them together.  It's "
"more flexible but a little more to type.  In general it works like the "
