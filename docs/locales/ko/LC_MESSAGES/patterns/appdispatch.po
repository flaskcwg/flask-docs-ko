"Application dispatching is the process of combining multiple Flask "
"applications on the WSGI level.  You can combine not only Flask "
"applications but any WSGI application.  This would allow you to run a "
"Django and a Flask application in the same interpreter side by side if "
"you want.  The usefulness of this depends on how the applications work "
"internally."

#: ../../patterns/appdispatch.rst:11

"The fundamental difference from :doc:`packages` is that in this case you "
"are running the same or different Flask applications that are entirely "
"isolated from each other. They run different configurations and are "
"dispatched on the WSGI level."

"Each of the techniques and examples below results in an ``application`` "
"object that can be run with any WSGI server. For development, use the "
"``flask run`` command to start a development server. For production, see "

"If you have entirely separated applications and you want them to work "
"next to each other in the same Python interpreter process you can take "
"advantage of the :class:`werkzeug.wsgi.DispatcherMiddleware`.  The idea "
"here is that each Flask application is a valid WSGI application and they "
"are combined by the dispatcher middleware into a larger one that is "
"dispatched based on prefix."

"Sometimes you might want to use multiple instances of the same "
"application with different configurations.  Assuming the application is "
"created inside a function and you can call that function to instantiate "
"it, that is really easy to implement.  In order to develop your "
"application to support creating new instances in functions have a look at"
" the :doc:`appfactories` pattern."
msgstr ""

#: ../../patterns/appdispatch.rst:70
msgid ""
"A very common example would be creating applications per subdomain.  For "
"instance you configure your webserver to dispatch all requests for all "
"subdomains to your application and you then use the subdomain information"
" to create user-specific instances.  Once you have your server set up to "
"listen on all subdomains you can use a very simple WSGI application to do"
" the dynamic application creation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../patterns/appdispatch.rst:77
msgid ""
"The perfect level for abstraction in that regard is the WSGI layer.  You "
"write your own WSGI application that looks at the request that comes and "
"delegates it to your Flask application.  If that application does not "
"exist yet, it is dynamically created and remembered."

#: ../../patterns/appdispatch.rst:136
msgid ""
"Dispatching by a path on the URL is very similar.  Instead of looking at "
"the ``Host`` header to figure out the subdomain one simply looks at the "
"request path up to the first slash."
msgstr ""

#: ../../patterns/appdispatch.rst:177
msgid ""
"The big difference between this and the subdomain one is that this one "
"falls back to another application if the creator function returns "
"``None``."
